It was early on a snowy morning.  James was just getting ready for school when he noticed that his keys weren't in their spot he'd placed them in last night.  He frantically searches the house, making a huge mess as he stumbles around looking for them.  He then remembers what he had done with them.  He walks out to his car and notices them siting on the front seat, locked inside.
