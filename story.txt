It was early on a snowy morning.  James was just getting ready for school when he noticed that his keys weren't in their spot he'd placed them in last night.  He frantically searches the house, making a huge mess as he stumbles around looking for them.  He then remembers what he had done with them.  He walks out to his car and notices them siting on the front seat, locked inside.

He was afraid he was going to be late for school. He decided to call a cab. He pulled his phone and typed his pickup address. To his astonishment the waiting time was 30 minutes. This was because there was severe snow storm last night and the roads were covered in thick sheet of white.
